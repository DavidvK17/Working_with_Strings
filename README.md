# Working with Strings

This is my implementation of another challenge I've found:
Write a program that receives a list of variable names written in underscore_case
and convert them to camelCase.
The input will come from a textarea inserted into the DOM (see code below to
insert the elements), and conversion will happen when the button is pressed.

For testinput and expected output please view:
